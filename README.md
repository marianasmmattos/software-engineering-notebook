## :pushpin: About

<p align="justify">
I'm planning this repository to have both notes or summaries for each topic I study and also external links listed on these subjects, as any awesome list you can search for. Those lists' items are gonna follow the pattern bellow:
</p>

`[type][title](author/origin) - [description][language][payed]`

<p align="justify">
The "type" section it's always an emoji with the media informed as the legend below explains. The title is, obviously, the title of each content and between parentheses you'll see the author's or site's name where the contet can be found. Title + origin are always gonna be a link wich redirects you for consuming every content. The "description" section is going to be very objective, single phrased only, about each link. Language and payed are optional information and also always represented by emojis.
</p>

:clapper: [type] Video content <br>
:pencil: [type] Text content <br>
📚 [type] Whole course <br>
💰 [payed] Payed content <br>
🇧🇷 [language] Portuguese <br>
🇺🇸 [language] English <br>

## :question: Prerequisites

- WebDev basics (HTML/CSS/JS Vanilla)
- Knowing any programming language syntax
- Worked with one or more colleagues in any project
- Understanding how back and frontend communicates between themselves
- Experienced building any personal app end-to-end, even if simple ones

<p align="justify">
It's not like you can't read or learn with whatever i'm writing if you don't have these prerequisites. Of course not. But you might enjoy it and take better advantage if you're fammiliar with the topics above. Some of them will help you understand the importance of concepts or how to apply them in your daily routine. Or maybe that's just what I think 'cause I've experienced it all before getting it. I don't know, it's a open source notebook, what you'd expect?

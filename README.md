## :pushpin: About

<p align="justify">
I'm planning this repository to have both notes or summaries for each topic I study and also external links listed on these subjects, as any awesome list you can search for. Those lists' items are gonna follow the pattern bellow:
</p>

`[type][title](author/origin) - [description][language][payed]`

<p align="justify">
The "type" section it's always an emoji with the media informed as the legend below explains. The title is, obviously, the title of each content and between parentheses you'll see the author's or site's name where the contet can be found. Title + origin are always gonna be a link wich redirects you for consuming every content. The "description" section is going to be very objective, single phrased only, about each link. Language and payed are optional information and also always represented by emojis.

# <h1 align="center"> üíª Introduction of Programming Paradigms üíª </h1>

> üõ†Ô∏è _Programming paradigm is basicaly a style when writing code, it's a model for problem solving. Every programming language allows you to choose one or more paradigms to follow._

## :pushpin: What are we talking about and how it'd be useful?

<p align="justify">
Programming isn't only about coding. In fact, coding might be only "how" and neither "what" or "why". And you know what? No solution is made with only "how". That's why we need some tools and concepts to do not good but great code. Paradigms are one step behind that. They dictate what solutions look like, so we can choose "how" while we have "what" and "why" in the macro scope of the problem.

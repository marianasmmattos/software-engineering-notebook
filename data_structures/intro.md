# <h1 align="center"> 💻 Introduction to Data Structures 💻 </h1>

> 🛠️ _Data structure is the way we systematicly organize a collection of data so it can be used effectively. It's a specialized format to  processing, retrieving and storing data._

## :pushpin: What are we talking about? Abstraction, Primitive & Non-primitive.

<p align="justify">
When coding, we dive into algorithms as solutions. The data structures we choose as tools for those solutions may be essencial to improve our code performance, even if for us as programmers it might seem equal while writing the system. Therey are essencial ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms, also, choosing the right ones may make the code easier to understand and cleaner.

<p align="justify">
Abstract Data Types (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. This means when thinking of ADT, we're talking about how this data structure should behave and what methods should it have. Imagine we go to point A to point B, the abstraction data type is "vehicle" while "bike" or "car" are the implementation of this abstraction, the data structure.

As programmers, we always need to think about the time and space our algorithm uses. That's what performance is all about. Big-O is the type of notation we use while wondering the worst scenario for our solution.

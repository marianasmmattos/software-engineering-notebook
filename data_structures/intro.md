# <h1 align="center"> 💻 Introduction to Data Structures 💻 </h1>

> 🛠️ _Data structure is the way we systematically organize a collection of data so it can be used effectively. It's a specialized format to  processing, retrieving and storing data._

## :pushpin: What are we talking about? Abstraction, Primitive & Non-primitive.

<p align="justify">
When coding, we dive into algorithms as solutions. The data structures we choose as tools for those solutions may be essencial to improve our code performance, even if for us as programmers it might seem equal while writing the system. Therey are essencial ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms, also, choosing the right ones may make the code easier to understand and cleaner.

<p align="justify">
Abstract Data Types (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. This means when thinking of ADT, we're talking about how this data structure should behave and what methods should it have. Imagine we go to point A to point B, the abstraction data type is "vehicle" while "bike" or "car" are implementations of this abstraction, the data structure.

<p align="justify">
As programmers, we always need to think about the time and space our algorithm uses. That's what performance is all about. Big-O is the type of notation we use while wondering the worst scenario for our solution.

Data structures might be often classified by their characteristics. They can be linear (sequential order) or non-linear (unordered sequence), homogeneous (all data items in given repository has the same type) or heterogeneous (many types of data), static (fixed sizes, structures and memory location at compile time) ou dynamic (when the size, structure and memory locations can change while we use it).

Data structures are often classified by two major categories: primitive and non-primitive. The primitive ones are the basic data structures that directly operate upon the machine instructions and are predefined in the language, consisting of: integer, float, character and boolean. Non-primitive data structures are derived from the primitive ones, they need to be explicited by programmers. They're also called “reference variables” or “object references” since they reference a memory location which stores the data.
